# turing-roulette

This is a fun, social twist on the [Turing Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test). This application will connect you to either a random person, or one of a random assortment of AI chat-bots. After a small time of interaction, you will be asked to say if you are speaking to a human or an AI.
